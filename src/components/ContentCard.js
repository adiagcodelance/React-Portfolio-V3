            Welcome to my portfolio webpage! my name is Aditya Agrawal, a
            Computer Scientist with an interest in web development/design. I
            thrive in creative projects and love challenges in fast-paced
            environments. This website showcases my journey through four
            iterations, each teaching me something new. I'm always filled with
            ideas to improve and recently added an iteration counter to mark the
            changes made since I started this portfolio project.
